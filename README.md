[**Business Model Canvas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) is a strategic management and lean startup template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's or product's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.
